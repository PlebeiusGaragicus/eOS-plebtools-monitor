# TODO
# turn this (the api modules) into my own repo and add a git+... in requirements.txt


# TODO
# turn these apps into a stand-alone app, that will run locally..

# but, then write a s start9 wrapper repo for this, and make sure the app can be told what environment it is running inside... so that its behavior will change
# depending on if it is running in a docker container, or on a local machine, or on a start9 node, etc...

# TODO
# make the images smaller - 500x500 is too big
